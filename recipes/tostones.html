        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tostones are a common carribean dish which is often served as 
            a side or salty snack. It is a popular staple throughout Puerto 
            Rico and the Domniquen Republic.
        </p>
        <p>They are made using twice fried green plantains which are refered to 
            as verdes which is spanish for green. This are plantains which are yet
            to ripen so they have a different flavor when fried from their ripe counterparts.
